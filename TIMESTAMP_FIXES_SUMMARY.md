# Timestamp and Performance Metrics Fixes Summary

## Issues Identified and Fixed:

### 1. **Pandas Timestamp Arithmetic Error**
**Issue**: `Addition/subtraction of integers and integer-arrays with Timestamp is no longer supported`

**Root Cause**: Newer versions of pandas (2.0+) deprecated direct arithmetic operations with Timestamp objects.

**Fixes Applied**:
- **LSTM Model** (`src/lstm_model.py`):
  - Fixed prediction date generation to use `pd.date_range()` instead of manual arithmetic
  - Converted dates to proper date objects to avoid timestamp issues
  
- **Visualizations** (`src/visualizations.py`):
  - Improved date handling in prediction charts
  - Fixed vertical line rendering by using ISO format strings instead of raw timestamps
  - Added robust fallbacks for date conversion errors

### 2. **Performance Metrics Not Loading**
**Issue**: Performance Metrics tab was empty for loaded models

**Root Cause**: Loaded models didn't include the `'results'` key that the performance metrics tab expected.

**Fixes Applied**:
- **Model Loading** (`app.py`):
  - Modified `load_existing_model()` to include a `'results'` dictionary
  - Added training metrics from model info to the results structure
  
- **Performance Tab** (`app.py`):
  - Enhanced performance metrics display to handle both trained and loaded models
  - Added fallback display for models without training history
  - Show available metrics (MAE, RMSE, Directional Accuracy, MSE) for loaded models

### 3. **Volume SMA Warning**
**Issue**: `module 'ta.volume' has no attribute 'volume_sma'`

**Status**: Already handled with proper fallback in `src/data_collector.py`. The warning is informational only and doesn't break functionality.

### 4. **Model Compatibility Warnings**
**Issue**: TensorFlow/Keras model compatibility warnings

**Status**: These are handled by the model compatibility handler and don't break functionality. The warnings are expected when loading models trained with different TensorFlow versions.

## Technical Details:

### Timestamp Fix Implementation:
```python
# OLD (problematic):
pred_dates = [base_date + timedelta(days=i+1) for i in range(len(pred_prices))]

# NEW (fixed):
pred_dates = pd.date_range(
    start=base_date + timedelta(days=1), 
    periods=len(pred_prices), 
    freq='D'
).date.tolist()
```

### Performance Metrics Fix:
```python
# OLD (missing results):
return {'model': model, 'model_info': model_info}

# NEW (includes results):
return {
    'model': model, 
    'model_info': model_info,
    'results': {
        'history': {},  # No training history for loaded models
        'train_metrics': model_info.get('metrics', {}),
        'val_metrics': {}
    }
}
```

## Impact:
- ✅ Eliminated pandas timestamp arithmetic errors
- ✅ Fixed performance metrics display for all model types
- ✅ Improved error handling and user experience
- ✅ Maintained backward compatibility
- ✅ Added informative fallbacks for missing data

## Verification:
All fixes have been implemented and tested. The application should now:
1. Generate predictions without timestamp errors
2. Display performance metrics for both new and loaded models
3. Handle edge cases gracefully
4. Provide informative messages when data is unavailable

## Notes:
- The Volume SMA warning is cosmetic and doesn't affect functionality
- Model compatibility warnings are expected and handled properly
- All fixes maintain backward compatibility with existing models
