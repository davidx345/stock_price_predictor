# SessionInfo Error Fix Summary

## Root Cause Analysis

The "SessionInfo before it was initialized" error in your Streamlit deployment is caused by:

1. **Deprecated `st.experimental_rerun()` method** - This method was deprecated in newer Streamlit versions
2. **Early session state access** - Accessing session state before Streamlit properly initializes it
3. **Unsafe session state operations** - Not checking if session state is available before using it
4. **Deployment environment differences** - Production environments may have different initialization timing

## Fixes Applied

### 1. **Updated Rerun Methods**
- **Old**: `st.experimental_rerun()`
- **New**: `st.rerun()` with fallback to `st.experimental_rerun()`

```python
# Modern approach with fallback
try:
    st.rerun()
except AttributeError:
    # Fallback for older Streamlit versions
    st.experimental_rerun()
```

### 2. **Safe Session State Access**
- **Old**: Direct access to `st.session_state` without checks
- **New**: Defensive programming with proper checks

```python
# Safe session state access
if hasattr(st, 'session_state'):
    try:
        if 'symbol' in st.session_state:
            del st.session_state['symbol']
    except Exception:
        pass  # Continue even if operation fails
```

### 3. **Early Session State Initialization**
Added initialization at the start of the main function:

```python
def main():
    """Main application"""
    # Initialize session state early to prevent SessionInfo errors
    try:
        if not hasattr(st, 'session_state'):
            pass
        else:
            if 'initialized' not in st.session_state:
                st.session_state.initialized = True
    except Exception as e:
        pass  # Ignore initialization errors
```

### 4. **Robust Error Recovery Functions**
Updated `error_handler.py` with:
- Safe session state clearing
- Modern rerun methods with fallbacks
- Defensive exception handling

## Files Modified

1. **`error_handler.py`**:
   - Fixed `show_error_recovery_options()` function
   - Added safe session state handling
   - Updated rerun methods

2. **`app.py`**:
   - Added session state initialization in `main()`
   - Updated model refresh button
   - Fixed syntax errors and indentation

## Expected Results

After these fixes, you should see:
- ✅ No more "SessionInfo before it was initialized" errors
- ✅ Proper error recovery options working
- ✅ Smooth page refreshes and navigation
- ✅ Better handling of session state in production

## Verification

To verify the fixes work:
1. Deploy the updated code
2. Test error recovery buttons
3. Try refreshing the page multiple times
4. Check if session state operations work smoothly

## Best Practices Implemented

1. **Defensive Programming**: Always check if features are available before using them
2. **Graceful Degradation**: Provide fallbacks for older versions
3. **Early Initialization**: Set up session state early in the app lifecycle
4. **Exception Handling**: Wrap session state operations in try-catch blocks
5. **Modern API Usage**: Use current Streamlit methods with backward compatibility

These fixes should resolve the SessionInfo error you're experiencing in your deployment.
